# Claude Code Helper

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and CLI tool for managing Claude Code bash command permissions and MCP tools across your projects. Provides AI agents with programmatic access to your Claude Code configuration while offering built-in safety features.

## MCP Server for Claude Code

Claude Code Helper functions as an MCP server, allowing AI agents to query and manage your Claude Code configurations programmatically. This enables automated permission management, tool discovery, and configuration analysis.

### Add to Claude Code

Add Claude Code Helper as an MCP server to your Claude Code configuration:

```bash
claude mcp add-json cch '{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@light-merlin-dark/claude-code-helper", "--mcp"],
  "env": {"NODE_NO_WARNINGS": "1"}
}'
```

If you have it installed globally, you can use:

```bash
claude mcp add-json cch '{
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "cch",
  "args": ["--mcp"],
  "env": {"NODE_NO_WARNINGS": "1"}
}'
```

### Available MCP Commands

Once added as an MCP server, the following commands are available to AI agents:

- **`reload-mcp`** - Reload MCP configurations from Claude CLI
- **`doctor`** - Run comprehensive system diagnostics and health checks  
- **`view-logs`** - View and filter Claude Code Helper log files
- **`discover-mcp-tools`** - Discover MCP tools used across projects with detailed analysis
- **`list-mcps`** - List all MCPs found across projects with usage information
- **`get-mcp-stats`** - Get comprehensive statistics about MCP usage across all projects
- **`list_permissions`** - Get all current bash command permissions
- **`discover_permissions`** - Find frequently used permissions across projects
- **`get_config`** - View current configuration and file paths
- **`analyze_safety`** - Check permissions for safety issues
- **`get_project_stats`** - Get statistics about configured projects

### MCP Usage Examples

When using Claude Code with the MCP server enabled, you can ask Claude to:

```
"Use CCH to reload the aia MCP"
→ Claude will use the reload-mcp command

"Run diagnostics on my Claude Code Helper setup"
→ Claude will use the doctor command

"Show me recent error logs from CCH"
→ Claude will use the view-logs command with error filtering

"Show me all the MCPs I'm using across my projects"
→ Claude will use the list-mcps command

"Find MCP tools I use frequently across my projects"
→ Claude will use the discover-mcp-tools command

"Give me comprehensive statistics about my MCP usage"
→ Claude will use the get-mcp-stats command

"Check what bash permissions I have configured"
→ Claude will use the list_permissions command

"Analyze my permissions for safety issues"
→ Claude will use the analyze_safety command

"Show me statistics about my Claude Code projects"
→ Claude will use the get_project_stats command
```

The MCP server enables Claude to programmatically manage your configurations without manual CLI interaction.

## What it does

Claude Code requires explicit permission to run terminal commands in your projects. This tool allows developers to:
- Act as an MCP server for AI agents to manage configurations programmatically
- Define a base set of permissions that should be available across all projects
- Discover and manage MCP tools used across projects
- Smart command expansion (e.g., `docker` → `docker:*`)
- Built-in safety guards against dangerous commands
- Apply permissions to multiple projects with detailed change tracking
- Backup and restore your Claude Code configuration
- Keep your permissions organized and consistent

## Usage

```bash
cch [options]
```

### Managing Permissions

List your current permissions:
```bash
cch --list-permissions      # or use short alias: cch -lp
```

Add a new permission (with smart expansion and auto-apply):
```bash
cch --add "docker"         # Automatically expands to "docker:*" and applies
cch --add "npm run build"  # Multi-word commands are added as-is
```

Discover frequently used permissions:
```bash
cch --discover             # Analyzes your projects and suggests common permissions
cch -dp                    # Short alias
```

Remove a permission:
```bash
cch --remove 2             # Remove permission #2 (with confirmation)
cch -rm 2 --force          # Remove without confirmation
```

Apply permissions to all projects:
```bash
cch --apply-permissions    # Apply to all projects with detailed change log
cch -ap                    # Short alias
```

### MCP Tool Management

Discover frequently used MCP tools:
```bash
cch --discover-mcp         # Find MCP tools used in 3+ projects
cch -dmc                   # Short alias
```

Reload MCP configurations:
```bash
cch --reload-mcp           # Interactive selection
cch -rmc                   # Short alias
cch -rmc aia               # Reload specific MCP
cch -rmc --force           # Reload all MCPs
```

MCP tools are identified by the `mcp__` prefix (e.g., `mcp__github__search_code:*`).

### Backup and Restore

Create a backup before making changes:
```bash
cch --backup-config                # Create default backup
cch --backup-config --name pre-update    # Create named backup
```

Restore from a backup if needed:
```bash
cch --restore-config               # Restore from default backup
cch --restore-config --name pre-update   # Restore specific backup
```

### Utility Commands

View your configuration:
```bash
cch --config                       # View current config and file paths
cch -c                             # Short alias
```

Check version history:
```bash
cch --changelog                    # View recent changes and updates
```

Diagnose and fix configuration issues:
```bash
cch --doctor                       # Find and fix issues in your Claude config
```

The doctor command will:
- Detect inconsistent tool wrapping (some with `Bash()`, some without)
- Find duplicate tool entries
- Identify dangerous commands
- Offer to fix all issues with interactive prompts

### Cleanup

Remove all Claude Code Helper data:
```bash
cch --delete-data                  # Delete all CCH data (requires confirmation)
cch -dd                            # Short alias
```

This will remove:
- Your permissions configuration
- All backup files
- User preferences
- The entire `~/.cch` directory

**Note**: Your Claude config (`~/.claude.json`) will be preserved.

  - **Permissions**: `~/.cch/permissions.json`
  - **Preferences**: `~/.cch/preferences.json`
  - **State**: `~/.cch/state.json`
  - **Backups**: `~/.cch/backups/`

## Default Permissions

If no permissions file exists, the following safe defaults are created:
- `make:*`
- `npm run:*`
- `npm test:*`
- `git status`
- `git diff:*`
- `git log:*`

## Safety Features

### Blocked Commands
The following commands are completely blocked for safety:
- `rm -rf /` and similar destructive commands
- Fork bombs
- Disk formatting commands
- Direct disk write operations

### Warning Commands
You'll receive warnings and confirmation prompts for:
- `rm` commands without specific paths
- `chmod 777` and similar permission changes
- Commands that could affect system files

### Smart Expansion
Simple commands are automatically expanded:
- `docker` → `docker:*`
- `npm` → `npm:*`
- `make` → `make:*`

## Examples

### Setting Up Permissions for All Projects

```bash
# 1. First, backup your current configuration
cch --backup-config --name before-setup

# 2. Check your current permissions
cch -lp

# 3. Add permissions you want available in all projects
cch -add docker    # Automatically expands to docker:* and applies
cch -add yarn      # No need to type the :* anymore!
cch -add pytest    # Smart expansion handles it for you

# 4. See the detailed changes that were made
# (Each add command shows what was changed in each project)

# 5. If needed, restore your original config
cch --restore-config --name before-setup
```

### Quick Permission Updates

```bash
# See what permissions you have
cch -lp

# Add a new tool with auto-apply
cch -add cargo    # Adds cargo:* and immediately applies to all projects

# The tool shows you exactly what changed in each project
```

### Discovering Common Permissions

```bash
# Let the tool analyze your projects
cch -dp

# It will show permissions used in multiple projects:
# 1. docker:*         (used in 8 projects)
# 2. yarn:*           (used in 6 projects)
# 3. pytest:*         (used in 3 projects)

# Select which ones to add (they'll be auto-applied)
```

### Managing MCP Tools

```bash
# Discover MCP tools used across projects
cch -dmc

# It will show MCP tools used in 3+ projects:
# 1. mcp__github__search_code:*    (used in 5 projects)
# 2. mcp__vssh__run_command:*      (used in 4 projects)

# Select which ones to add to your base permissions
```

### Safety Examples

```bash
# Dangerous commands are blocked
cch -add "rm -rf /"
# ⛔ BLOCKED: "rm -rf /"
# This command could cause irreversible system damage

# Warnings for risky commands
cch -add rm
# ⚠️  WARNING: "rm" is a potentially dangerous permission
# Could permanently delete files
# Type "yes" to confirm:
```

## Features in Detail

### Configuration Viewer
The `--config` command shows you:
- Your current base commands
- Total number of configured projects
- All configuration file paths (clickable in many terminals)
- Available backup files with creation dates

### Version History
The `--changelog` command displays:
- Recent version updates
- New features and improvements
- Bug fixes and changes

## How It Works

Claude Code Helper operates in two modes to manage command permissions stored in `~/.claude.json`:

### MCP Server Mode
When configured as an MCP server in Claude Code:
1. **Protocol Communication**: Handles MCP requests from AI agents via stdio
2. **Command Processing**: Executes permission queries and configuration analysis
3. **Real-time Access**: Provides immediate access to your Claude Code configuration
4. **Safety Integration**: All MCP commands respect the same safety rules as CLI

### CLI Mode & Core Functionality
1. **Maintains a Permissions Set**: Your commonly used permissions are stored in `~/.cch/permissions.json`
2. **Smart Expansion**: Simple commands like `docker` are automatically expanded to `docker:*`
3. **Safety First**: Dangerous commands are blocked or require confirmation
4. **Auto-Apply**: New permissions are immediately applied to all projects (configurable)
5. **Preserves Project-Specific Permissions**: Existing project permissions are kept, duplicates are removed
6. **Detailed Tracking**: Shows exactly what changed in each project
7. **Formats Correctly**: Permissions are automatically wrapped in the required `Bash()` format for Claude Code
