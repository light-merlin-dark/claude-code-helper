  <p><em>Swiss Army knife for Claude Code configuration management</em></p>
</div>

**A versatile CLI-first tool that can be used as either a CLI or MCP server for swift management of your Claude configuration file.**

Tell Claude to run `cch` commands directly - it just works! Every command is **dry-run by default** for safety.

## üéØ Why CCH?

**üîß CLI-First Design**: Simple commands that Claude can run directly. No MCP complexity required - just `cch clean` and you're done.

**üõ°Ô∏è Dry-Run by Default**: Every cleanup command shows you what will happen BEFORE making changes. Use `--execute` when ready.

**üßπ Smart Cleanup**: Reduced configs from 14MB to 84KB (99.4% reduction). Focuses on removing images and large pastes intelligently.

**üö® Always-On Security**: Automatic secret detection on EVERY command with immediate one-command remediation.

**üìä Config Intelligence**: Analyzes your entire Claude Code workspace, discovering patterns and suggesting optimizations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @light-merlin-dark/claude-code-helper

# Clean your bloated config (dry-run by default!)
cch clean                  # Preview what will be removed
cch clean --execute        # Actually perform cleanup

# Remove empty projects
cch clean projects         # Preview first
cch clean projects -e      # Then execute

# Nuclear option - clear all history
cch clean history          # See what would be cleared
cch clean history -e       # Execute if needed
```

## Key Features

**‚ú® Unified Clean Command**: Smart, modular cleanup system
- `cch clean` - Remove large pastes, images, dangerous permissions
- `cch clean projects` - Remove empty or accidental projects  
- `cch clean history` - Clear all conversation history
- Always shows preview first, requires `--execute` to run

**ü§ñ Works Both Ways**: Use as CLI or MCP
- **CLI Mode**: Tell Claude to run `cch` commands directly
- **MCP Mode**: Install as MCP server for advanced integrations
- Most users only need the CLI - MCP is optional!

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @light-merlin-dark/claude-code-helper

# That's it! Start using CLI commands immediately
cch clean              # Preview config cleanup
cch --audit            # Analyze configuration
```

## üéÆ CLI Usage (Recommended)

Just tell Claude to run these commands - no MCP setup needed!

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Clean Commands (all dry-run by default!)
cch clean              # Smart cleanup - removes images, large pastes
cch clean projects     # Remove empty/accidental projects
cch clean history      # Clear all conversation history
cch clean help         # See all options

# Always add --execute or -e to actually run:
cch clean -e           # Execute after preview

# Security & Health
cch --audit            # Full config analysis with secret detection
cch --mask-secrets-now # Emergency secret masking

# Permission Management  
cch -lp                # List current permissions
cch -add "docker"      # Add permission (auto-expands to docker:*)
cch -ap                # Apply permissions to all projects
```

### üîß Fix Settings Command (NEW!)

Claude Code recently introduced stricter validation for tool permissions. If you're seeing validation errors in the UI, this command can fix them all at once:

```bash
# Fix all Claude settings formatting issues
cch fix-settings       # Preview what will be fixed (dry-run)
cch fix-settings -e    # Apply fixes to all settings files

# What it fixes:
# - Tool names must start with uppercase: "git status" ‚Üí "Git status"
# - Wildcard syntax: "Bash(command *)" ‚Üí "Bash(command :*)"
# - MCP tool capitalization: "mcp__tool__name" ‚Üí "Mcp__tool__name"
```

This command scans ALL your Claude settings files recursively and can fix hundreds of validation errors across multiple projects in seconds - something the Claude UI can't do in bulk!

### Why CLI First?

- **Simple**: Claude runs commands directly - no complex setup
- **Safe**: Every command previews changes before making them
- **Fast**: Instant results without MCP overhead
- **Clear**: See exactly what will happen before it does

## üîå Optional: MCP Setup (Advanced)

For power users who want MCP integration:

```bash
cch install            # Install as MCP server in Claude Code
```
