### ðŸš€ Major Update - Permissions System Overhaul

This release transforms the command management system into a comprehensive permissions system with built-in safety features and improved developer experience.

### Added

- **Dangerous Command Guards**: 
  - Completely blocks destructive commands like `rm -rf /`
  - Warns about potentially dangerous commands with confirmation prompts
- **Detailed Change Tracking**: Shows exactly what permissions were added/removed per project
- **Auto-Apply Feature**: New permissions are immediately applied to all projects (configurable)
- **User Preferences System** (`~/.cch/preferences.json`):
  - Configure auto-apply behavior
  - Control change summary display
  - Manage warning suppression
- **Startup Safety Check**: Automatically checks for dangerous permissions on startup

### Changed
- **Complete Terminology Update**: "Commands" â†’ "Permissions" throughout
- **New Command Structure**:
  - `-lp/--list-permissions` (replaces `-lc`)
  - `-add/--add-permission` (replaces `-ac`)
  - `-rm/--remove-permission` (replaces `-dc`)
  - `-ap/--apply-permissions` (replaces `-ec`)
  - `-dp/--discover` (replaces `-sc`)
- **File Rename**: `base-commands.json` â†’ `permissions.json`
- **Improved Feedback**: Clear, colorful output showing permission changes

### Enhanced
