- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Migrated to Bun's built-in test runner for fast execution
  - Comprehensive unit tests for all services
  - Integration tests for service interactions
  - End-to-end tests for CLI commands
  - 78 tests passing with parallel execution

### Changed
- **Complete Architecture Overhaul**:
  - Migrated from monolithic structure to service-based architecture
  - All services now use dependency injection pattern

  - Enhanced error handling with structured error types
  
- **Improved Code Organization**:

  - Type-safe service interactions

### Enhanced
- **Better Extensibility**: Easy to add new services and commands
- **Improved Testability**: All services can be easily mocked
- **Performance**: Services are lazy-loaded on demand
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with strict typing

### Technical Details
- Implemented all core services from the blueprint
- Created foundation for MCP server mode (ready for next phase)
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility with existing CLI
- Prepared codebase for binary compilation with Bun

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-06

### Added
- **Doctor Command** (`--doctor`): Diagnose and fix configuration issues
  - Detects inconsistent tool wrapping (some with `Bash()`, some without)
  - Finds and removes duplicate tool entries
  - Identifies dangerous commands with all-or-nothing removal
  - Runs all checks concurrently for optimal performance
  - Creates automatic backups before making changes

### Fixed
- **Short Flags**: Fixed issue where short flags like `-lp`, `-dp`, `-ap`, and `-add` weren't working in production
- **Dangerous Command Detection**: Fixed case sensitivity issue preventing proper detection of commands like `chmod -R 777`

### Improved
- Added comprehensive test coverage for doctor command functionality
- Enhanced parseArgs to properly handle multi-character short flags

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-06

### 🚀 Major Update - Permissions System Overhaul

This release transforms the command management system into a comprehensive permissions system with built-in safety features and improved developer experience.

### Added
