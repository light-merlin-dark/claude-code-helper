### üöÄ Major Architecture Refactor - Separate MCP Binary

This release follows the successful AIA blueprint approach by introducing a dedicated MCP server binary and simplified installation process, making CCH more reliable and easier to use.

### Added
- **Dedicated MCP Binary**: New `cch-mcp` binary specifically for MCP server operations

### Fixed
- **Tool Discovery**: Claude Code now properly detects all CCH tools on startup
- **Binary Execution**: Eliminated the confusing `--mcp` flag requirement
- **Installation UX**: Clear, friendly output with next steps and available tools

### Developer Experience
- Installation is now just two commands: `npm install` and `cch --install`
- No more manual Claude MCP configuration required
- Automatic handling of existing installations during setup
- Clear success/error messages with actionable next steps

## [2.2.3] - 2025-06-23

### üîß MCP Tool Naming Fix

This release fixes the MCP tool naming convention to align with Claude Code's requirements, ensuring all CCH tools are properly recognized and available in the chat interface.
